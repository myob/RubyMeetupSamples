RubyMeetupSamples
=================
This is a 'holding tank' for code samples for use by members of the Lansing Ruby Meetup.
Currently, it contains a markov chain based text manipulator, a text file for use by that code, and a random number
tester.  The random number tester generates 10K random numbers between 0 and 9 using 3 approaches, and then shows
how many times each of the 10 possibilities occur.  In theory, there should be 1k of each.  See if you think
it's worthwhile using one of the alternative approaches or if the 'out of the box' Ruby rand() method does the job
plenty well enough.
Note that the random number tester requires you to install a gem, or comment out the code for remote_random.
Share and Enjoy!
